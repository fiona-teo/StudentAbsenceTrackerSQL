# StudentAbsenceTrackerSQL

This project involves the creation of a relational database system to manage student contact details and track their planned vacation periods. The system consists of two primary tables: student and studentVacation. It is designed to efficiently store, manage, and query information about students and their availability based on vacation schedules.
